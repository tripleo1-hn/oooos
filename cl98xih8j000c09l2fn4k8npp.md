### Why Linux?
Because it's free.
And also because it's better than all the other free stuff.
But really because that's what I'm used to.

### Why ZFS?
Because, even though in my use case, it can be simulated with btrfs and some scripts, it can become very useful. For example if you want RAID or mirroring or something.

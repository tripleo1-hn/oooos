I did not compile the notes for “the last 2 years”.

dash-to-dock and paperwm mean a lot to me.

I never got material-shell or pano working. This means something (not necc alot).

(solution is probs, downgrade into a vm)

There are limitations:

1. It's annoying. (It is annoying, cf - gtk4-layer-shell for fuzzel).
    
2. My desktop is not a tablet. (long-presses, second button).
    
3. Nobody can figure out configuration. (cf tweaks)
    

Will excoriate KDE/Plasma next.
